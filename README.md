Build
------------
First of all, you must have a dotnet core 2.0, then if you need an executable file just run one of the files below
* `build_win10-x64_Debug.cmd`
* `build_win10-x64_Release.cmd`

Of course you can run it from Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code by opening solution project
* `Spacetris.sln`

If you want to run it from the console go to "Spacetris\Spacetris" and type
* `dotnet run`
